This project was created through following along (and entirely copying) Corey Schafer's Flask blog tutorial. The aim was to practice flask development by creating a full-stack project i.e. a blog.

The only real differences between this blog and the original is how i configured the database, secret key etc. I hard-coded some of the configurations, Corey Schafer recommends configuring these as environment variables on your own machine, for security reasons.
