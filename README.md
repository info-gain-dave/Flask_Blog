This project was created through following along, and entirely copying, Corey Schafer's Flask blog tutorial. The aim was to practice flask development by creating a full-stack project i.e. a blog.

The only differences between this blog and the original is in how I configure the database, secret key etc. I hard-coded most of the configurations, Corey Schafer recommends configuring these as environment variables on your own machine, for security reasons. To install the project, you can copy this or the original (final version) and make changes to the config.py file. You can either hard-code the necessary configurations or set environment variables on your own machine to match the variables found in the config.py file. You will also need to add your own gmail account.
